# introduction
this a A.I. teaching assistantï¼Œbesically we program this ta as it can answear what ever you ask based on the previous question the other students asked.you might think first this program is very trival because you can do it all on google or baidu.apparently you are so naive,since we call this TA a.i. it means it can answear the question nobody ask before,what a marvelous work isnt it.

# technical details
i bet you from now want to know more about this A.I. ta,so lets get into the detail of this 

1.  

# how to run
because we use mongodb to restore data and *pytorch* framework which is obvious too large to install and you might have to recompile its source file,its not likely for the judges to run our program's python part,and the db is also a problem.

so let's introducing the tech-stack of our program we use simply jquery as the frontie and koa as background,use mongodb as permenant data storage,and finally pytorch to perform deeplearing training.

if you insist
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
will do fine
